## Personal genomics comparison matrix creator

This program takes as input one or more files in 23andMe format and outputs a
tab-separated spreadsheet showing which files contain which markers.

To use this program, execute `./comparison-matrix.py <file>...`

For example, you could pass the program a file from 23andMe, a file from
Ancestry.com, and a file from Genes for Good, and then search the output for a
particular SNP to see which of the three services test for it.
